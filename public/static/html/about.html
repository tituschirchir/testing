                Virtual Tree Owners aims to build a collaborative network between Kenyan farmers and global donors. Our
                goal is to address deforestation and poverty through tree planting. Participating donors can contribute
                money to sponsor the cost of raising a seedling, which will allow farmers in rural Kenya to obtain the
                seedlings for free and raise them on their property.

                Sh. 10 (US ${{ one_tree_cost }}) donation will fund one tree seedling whose value will
                be 2000 times greater after 10 years. Not only does this enable people around the world to contribute to
                reforestation despite lack of resources/land to raise trees themselves, but the livelihood of the Kenyan
                farmers is also improved. Farmers can use and sell the products of the tree, improving their food
                security and economic standing. We are currently serving <strong>{{ farmers.length }} </strong> farmers
                who are tending to <strong>{{ getTotalTrees() }}</strong> trees.
